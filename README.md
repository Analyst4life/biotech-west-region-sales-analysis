# biotech-west-region-sales-analysis

Data analysis of synthetic biotech sales in the Western United States.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes synthetic sales data for biotech products in the Western U.S. region. The primary goal is to demonstrate core data analysis skills using tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau.

Throughout the project, I clean and organize the dataset, explore patterns in sales performance, create visual summaries, and simulate how insights might be communicated in a real-world sales context.

The dataset is synthetic and based on publicly available product information. All sales data is fictional and created solely for learning and portfolio purposes.
