# biotech-west-region-sales-analysis

Data analysis of synthetic biotech sales in the Western United States.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes synthetic sales data for biotech products in the Western U.S. region.
The primary goal is to demonstrate core data analysis skills using tools such as Excel, SQL, and Python.

The dataset did not require cleaning, allowing me to focus on exploring sales patterns, generating visual summaries, and simulating how insights might be communicated in a real-world business context.

The dataset is synthetic and based on publicly available product information. All sales data is fictional and created solely for learning and portfolio purposes.
